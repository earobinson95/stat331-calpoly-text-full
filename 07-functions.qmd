## Check-ins {#ch7-checkins .unnumbered}

There is one check-in for this week:

+ [Check-in 7.1: Writing Functions](#checkin7-1)

:::

<br>

A **function** is a set of actions that we group together and name. Throughout this course, you've used a bunch of different functions in R that are built into the language or added through packages: `mean`, `ggplot`, `filter`. In this chapter, we'll be writing our own functions.

## When to write a function?

If you've written the same code (with a few minor changes, like variable names) more than twice, you should probably write a function instead of copy pasting. The motivation behind this is the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principle [@wickham2016r]. There are a few benefits to this rule:

1. Your code stays neater (and shorter), so it is easier to read, understand, and maintain.

2. If you need to fix the code because of errors, you only have to do it in one place.

3. You can re-use code in other files by keeping functions you need regularly in a file (or if you're really awesome, in your own package!)

4. If you name your functions well, your code becomes easier to understand thanks to grouping a set of actions under a descriptive function name.

### Learn more in R4DS {-}

There is some extensive material on this subject in [R for Data Science on functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html). If you want to really understand how functions work in R, that is a good place to go.

If you are interested in reading about "best practices", I recommend reading [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) [@wilson2014best].

:::

<br/>

::: ex

This example is modified from R for Data Science [@wickham2016r, Chapter 19]. 

What does this code do? Does it work as intended?

```{r function-copy-paste-error}
df <- tibble::tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)

df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$c, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The code rescales a set of variables to have a range from 0 to 1. But, because of the copy-pasting, the code's author made a mistake and forgot to change an `a` to `b`. 

Writing a function to rescale a variable would prevent this type of copy-paste error.

To write a function, we first analyze the code to determine how many inputs it has

```{r}
df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(df$a, na.rm = TRUE))
```

This code has only one input: `df$a`. 

To convert the code into a function, we first rewrite it using general names

In this case, it might help to replace `df$a` with `x`.

```{r}
x <- df$a 

(x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(x, na.rm = TRUE) - min(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Then, we make it a bit easier to read, removing duplicate computations if possible (for instance, computing `min` two times).


In R, we can use the `range` function, which computes the maximum and minimum at the same time and returns the result as `c(min, max)`

```{r}
rng <- range(x, na.rm = T)

(x - rng[1])/(rng[2] - rng[1])
```

Finally, we turn this code into a function

```{r}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = T)
  (x - rng[1])/(rng[2] - rng[1])
}

rescale01(df$a)
```

- The name of the function, `rescale01`, describes what the function does - it rescales the data to between 0 and 1. 
- The function takes one **argument**, named `x`; any references to this value within the function will use `x` as the name. This allows us to use the function on `df$a`, `df$b`, `df$c`, and so on, with `x` as a placeholder name for the data we're working on at the moment.
- The code that actually does what your function is supposed to do goes in the **body** of the function, between `{` and `}`
- The function **returns** the last value computed: in this case, `(x - rng[1])/(rng[2]-rng[1])`. You can make this explicit by adding a `return()` statement around that calculation.

The process for creating a function is important: first, you figure out how to do the thing you want to do. Then, you simplify the code as much as possible. Only at the end of that process do you create an actual function.

## Syntax

![R syntax for defining functions. Portions of the command that indicate the function name, function scope, and return statement are highlighted.](images/07-writing-functions/Annotating_function_syntax.png)

:::
:::

In R, functions are defined (or assigned names) the same as other variables, using `<-`, but we specify the arguments a function takes by using the `function()` statement. The contents of the function are contained within `{` and `}`. If the function returns a value, a `return()` statement can be used; alternately, if there is no return statement, the last computation in the function will be returned.

## Arguments and Parameters

An **argument** is the name for the object you pass into a function.

A **parameter** is the name for the object once it is inside the function (or the name of the thing as defined in the function).

::: ex

Let's examine the difference between arguments and parameters by writing a function that takes a puppy's name and returns "<name> is a good pup!".


```{r}
dog <- "Eddie"

goodpup <- function(name) {
  paste(name, "is a good pup!")
}

goodpup(dog)
```

In this example R function, when we call `goodpup(dog)`, `dog` is the argument. `name` is the parameter. 

What is happening inside the computer's memory as `goodpup` runs?

![A sketch of the execution of the program `goodpup`, showing that `name` is only defined within the local environment that is created while `goodpup` is running. We can never access `name` in our global environment.](images/function_argument_parameters.png)


:::

This is why the distinction between **arguments** and **parameters** matters. Parameters are only accessible while inside of the function - and in that local environment, we need to call the object by the parameter name, not the name we use outside the function (the argument name). 

We can even call a function with an argument that isn't defined outside of the function call: `goodpup("Tesla")` produces "`r goodpup("Tesla")`". Here, I do not have a variable storing the string "Tesla", but I can make the function run anyways. So "Tesla" here is an argument to `goodpup` but it is not a variable in my environment.

This is a confusing set of concepts and it's ok if you only just sort of get what I'm trying to explain here. Hopefully it will become more clear as you write more code.

::: ex
### Example {-}

For each of the following blocks of code, identify the function name, function arguments, parameter names, and return statements. When the function is called, see if you can predict what the output will be.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Function {-}

```{r function-predict-2}

my_mean <- function(x) {
  censor_x <- sample(x, size = length(x) - 2, replace = F)
  mean(censor_x)
}

```

```{r function-predict-2-call, eval = F}
set.seed(3420523)
my_mean(1:10)
```

### Answer {-}

- Function name: `my_mean`
- Function parameters: x
- Function arguments: 1:10
- Function output: an average value for the censor_x numerical vector *(varies each time the function is run unless you set the seed)*

```{r function-predict2-results}
set.seed(3420523)
my_mean(1:10)
```
:::
:::

### Named Arguments and Parameter Order

In the examples above, you didn't have to worry about what order parameters were passed into the function, because there were 0 and 1 parameters, respectively. But what happens when we have a function with multiple parameters?

```{r}

divide <- function(x, y) {
  x / y
}

```

In this function, the order of the parameters matters! `divide(3, 6)` does not produce the same result as `divide(6, 3)`. As you might imagine, this can quickly get confusing as the number of parameters in the function increases.

In this case, it can be simpler to use the parameter names when you pass in arguments.

```{r}
divide(3, 6)

divide(x = 3, y = 6)

divide(y = 6, x = 3)

divide(6, 3)

divide(x = 6, y = 3)

divide(y = 3, x = 6)

```

As you can see, the order of the arguments doesn't much matter, as long as you use named arguments, but if you don't name your arguments, the order very much matters.

## Input Validation

When you write a function, you often assume that your parameters will be of a certain type. But you can't guarantee that the person using your function knows that they need a certain type of input. In these cases, it's best to **validate** your function input.

::: ex

In R, you can use `stopifnot()` to check for certain essential conditions. If you want to provide a more illuminating error message, you can check your conditions using `if()` or `if(){ } else{ }` and then use `stop("better error message")` in the body of the `if` or `else` statement. 

::: panel-tabset

### `stopifnot()`
```{r, error = T}
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

add("tmp", 3)

add <- function(x, y) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x), 
            is.numeric(y)
            )
  x + y
}

add("tmp", 3)
add(3, 4)
```
### `if(){ } else { }`
```{r, error = T}
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

add <- function(x, y) {
  if(is.numeric(x) & is.numeric(y)) {
    x + y
  } else {
    stop("Argument input for x or y is not numeric")
  }
}

add("tmp", 3)
add(3, 4)
```

### `if(){stop()}`
```{r, error = T}
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

add <- function(x, y) {
  if(!is.numeric(x) | !is.numeric(y)) {
    stop("Argument input for x or y is not numeric")
  }
    x + y
}

add("tmp", 3)
add(3, 4)
```
:::
:::

Input validation is one aspect of **defensive programming** - programming in such a way that you try to ensure that your programs don't error out due to unexpected bugs by anticipating ways your programs might be misunderstood or misused. If you're interested, Wikipedia has [more about defensive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming).


## Scope

When talking about functions, for the first time we start to confront a critical concept in programming, which is scope. **Scope** is the part of the program where the name you've given a variable is valid - that is, where you can use a variable.

::: column-margin
::: youtube-video-container
<iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGByw2FVHIk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
:::
:::

> A variable is only available from inside the region it is created.

What do I mean by the part of a program? The **lexical scope** is the portion of the code (the set of lines of code) where the name is valid.

The concept of scope is best demonstrated through a series of examples, so in the rest of this section, I'll show you some examples of how scope works and the concepts that help you figure out what "scope" actually means in practice.


### Name Masking

Scope is most clearly demonstrated when we use the same variable name inside and outside a function. Note that this is 1) bad programming practice, and 2) fairly easily avoided if you can make your names even slightly more creative than `a`, `b`, and so on. But, for the purposes of demonstration, I hope you'll forgive my lack of creativity in this area so that you can see how name masking works.

::: ex

What does this function return, 10 or 20? 

::: panel-tabset

#### Pseudocode {-}

```
a <- 10

myfun <- function() {
  a <- 20
  a
}

myfun()
```

#### Sketch {-}

![A sketch of the global environment as well as the environment within `myfun()`. Because `a=20` inside `myfun()`, when we call `myfun()`, we get the value of `a` within that environment, instead of within the global environment.](images/function-scope.png)

#### R Function {-}

```{r}
#| eval: true
a <- 10

myfun <- function() {
  a <- 20
  a
}

myfun()

a
```

:::

:::

The lexical scope of the function is the area that is between the braces. Outside the function, `a` has the value of 10, but inside the function, `a` has the value of 20. So when we call `myfun()`, we get 20, because the scope of `myfun` is the **local context** where `a` is evaluated, and the value of `a` in that environment dominates.

This is an example of **name masking**, where names defined inside of a function mask names defined outside of a function.


### Environments and Scope

Another principle of scoping is that if you call a function and then call the same function again, the function's environment is re-created each time. Each function call is unrelated to the next function call when the function is defined using local variables.

::: ex

::: panel-tabset

#### Pseudocode {-}

```
myfun <- function() {
  if aa is not defined
    aa <- 1
  else
    aa <- aa + 1
}

myfun()
myfun()

```

What does this output?

#### Sketch {-}

![When we define myfun, we create a template for an environment with variables and code to excecute. Each time `myfun()` is called, that template is used to create a new environment. This prevents successive calls to `myfun()` from affecting each other -- which means `a = 1` every time.](images/function-scope-environment.png)


#### R Function {-}

```{r}
myfun <- function() {
  if (!exists("aa")) {
    aa <- 1
  } else {
    aa <- aa + 1
  }
  return(aa)
}

myfun()
myfun()
```

:::

:::

### Dynamic Lookup

Scoping determines where to look for values -- when, however, is determined by the sequence of steps in the code. When a function is called, the **calling environment** (the global environment or set of environments at the time the function is called) determines what values are used. 

If an object doesn't exist in the function's environment, the global environment will be searched next; if there is no object in the global environment, the program will error out. This behavior, combined with changes in the calling environment over time, can mean that the output of a function can change based on objects outside of the function.

::: ex

::: panel-tabset

#### Pseudocode {-}

```
myfun <- function(){
  x + 1
}

x <- 14

myfun()

x <- 20

myfun()

```

What will the output be of this code?

#### Sketch {-}

  x + 1
}

## Debugging

Now that you're writing functions, it's time to talk a bit about debugging techniques. This is a lifelong topic - as you become a more advanced programmer, you will need to develop more advanced debugging skills as well (because you'll become more adept at screwing things up). 

![The faces of debugging (by Allison Horst)](https://cdn.myportfolio.com/45214904-6a61-4e23-98d6-b140f8654a40/51084276-ab7f-4c57-a0e7-5cf14a277359_rw_1920.png?h=825c5593149a63edef46664796766751)

Let's start with the basics: print debugging.

### Print Debugging

This technique is basically exactly what it sounds like. You insert a ton of print statements to give you an idea of what is happening at each step of the function.

Let's try it out on the previous example (see what I did there?)

::: ex

Note that I've modified the code slightly so that we store the value into `returnval` and then return it later - this allows us to see the code execution without calling functions twice (which would make the print output a bit more confusing). 

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  print ("Entering Outer Function")
  print (paste("x =", x))
  f <- function(x) {
    print ("Entering Middle Function")
    print (paste("x = ", x))
    f <- function() {
      print ("Entering Inner Function")
      print (paste("x = ", x))
      print (paste("Inner Function: Returning", x^2))
      x ^ 2
    }
    returnval <- f() + 1
    print (paste("Middle Function: Returning", returnval))
    returnval
  }
  returnval <- f(x) * 2
  print (paste("Outer Function: Returning", returnval))
  returnval
}
f(10)
```

### General Debugging Strategies

> Debugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer. - some t-shirt I saw once

The overall process is well described in [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging.html) by H. Wickham^[the 0th step is from the 1st edition, the remaining steps are from the 2nd.]; I've copied it here because it's such a succinct distillation of the process, but I've adapted some of the explanations to this class rather than the original context of package development. 

0. Realize that you have a bug

1. **Google!** In R you can automate this with the `errorist` and `searcher` packages, but general Googling the error + the programming language + any packages you think are causing the issue is a good strategy.

2. **Make the error repeatable**: This makes it easier to figure out what the error is, faster to iterate, and easier to ask for help.
    - Use binary search (remove 1/2 of the code, see if the error occurs, if not go to the other 1/2 of the code. Repeat until you've isolated the error.)
    - Generate the error faster - use a minimal test dataset, if possible, so that you can ask for help easily and run code faster. This is worth the investment if you've been debugging the same error for a while. 
    - Note which inputs *don't* generate the bug -- this negative "data" is helpful when asking for help.

3. **Figure out where it is**. Debuggers may help with this, but you can also use the [scientific method](http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa17/classes/13-debugging/#find_the_bug_using_the_scientific_method) to explore the code, or the tried-and-true method of using lots of `print()` statements.

4. **Fix it and test it**. The goal with tests is to ensure that the same error doesn't pop back up in a future version of your code. Generate an example that will test for the error, and add it to your documentation. 


There are several other general strategies for debugging:

- Retype (from scratch) your code    
This works well if it's a short function or a couple of lines of code, but it's less useful if you have a big script full of code to debug. However, it does sometimes fix really silly typos that are hard to spot, like having typed `<--` instead of `<-` in R and then wondering why your answers are negative. 

- Visualize your data as it moves through the program. This may be done using `print()` statements, or the debugger, or some other strategy depending on your application.

- Tracing statements. Again, this is part of `print()` debugging, but these messages indicate progress - "got into function x", "returning from function y", and so on. 

- Rubber ducking. Have you ever tried to explain a problem you're having to someone else, only to have a moment of insight and "oh, never mind"? Rubber ducking outsources the problem to a nonjudgmental entity, such as a rubber duck^[Some people use cats, but I find that they don't meet the nonjudgmental criteria. Of course, they're equally judgmental whether your code works or not, so maybe that works if you're a cat person, which I am not. Dogs, in my experience, can work, but often will try to comfort you when they realize you're upset, which both helps and lessens your motivation to fix the problem. A rubber duck is the perfect dispassionate listener.]. You simply explain, in terms simple enough for your rubber duck to understand, exactly what your code does, line by line, until you've found the problem. [A more thorough explanation can be found at gitduck.com](https://gitduck.com/blog/improve-how-to-code-with-rubber-duck-debugging/). 

![You may find it helpful to procure a rubber duck expert for each language you work in. I use color-your-own rubber ducks to endow my ducks with certain language expertise. Other people use plain rubber ducks and give them capes.](images/rubber_duck_cape.png){width="50%"}


Do not be surprised if, in the process of debugging, you encounter new bugs. This is a problem that's well-known it has an [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/1739/). At some point, getting up and going for a walk may help. Redesigning your code to be more modular and more organized is also a good idea.

**Dividing Problems into Smaller Parts**


> “Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it.” -René Descartes, Discourse on Method 

In programming, as in life, big, general problems are very hard to solve effectively. Instead, the goal is to break a problem down into smaller pieces that may actually be solveable. 

We'll start with a non-programming example:

::: ex

1. **General problem statement** : "I'm exhausted all the time"    
Ok, so this is a problem that many of us have from time to time (or all the time). If we get a little bit more specific at outlining the problem, though, we can sometimes get a bit more insight into how to solve it.

2. **Specific problem statement**: "I wake up in the morning and I don't have any energy to do anything. I want to go back to sleep, but I have too much to do to actually give in and sleep. I spend my days worrying about how I'm going to get all of the things on my to-do list done, and then I lie awake at night thinking about how many things there are to do tomorrow. I don't have time for hobbies or exercise, so I drink a lot of coffee instead to make it through the day."    
This is a much more specific list of issues, and some of these issues are actually things we can approach separately.

3. **Separating things into solvable problems:**    
Moving through the list above, we can isolate a few issues. Some of these issues are undoubtedly related to each other, but we can approach them separately (for the most part).
    1. Poor quality sleep (tired in the morning, lying awake at night)
    2. Too many things to do (to-do list)
    3. Chemical solutions to low energy (coffee during the day)
    4. Anxiety about completing tasks (worrying, insomnia)
    5. Lack of personal time for hobbies or exercise


4. **Brainstorm Solutions:**
    1. Get a check-up to rule out any other issues that could cause sleep quality degradation - depression, anxiety, sleep apnea, thyroid conditions, etc.
        - Ask the doctor about taking melatonin supplements for a short time to ensure that sleep starts off well (note, don't take medical advice from a stats textbook!)
    2. Reformat your to-do list:
        - Set time limits for things on the to-do list 
        - Break the to-do list into smaller, manageable tasks that can be accomplished within a relatively short interval - such as an hour
        - Sort the to-do list by priority and level of "fun" so that each day has a few hard tasks and a couple of easy/fun tasks. Do the hard tasks first, and use the easy/fun tasks as a reward.
    3. Set a time limit for caffeine (e.g. no coffee after noon) so that caffeine doesn't contribute to poor quality sleep
    4. Address anxiety with medication (from 1), scheduled time for mindfulness meditation, and/or self-care activities
    5. Scheduling time for exercise/hobbies
        - scheduling exercise in the morning to take advantage of the endorphins generated by working out
        - scheduling hobbies in the evening to reward yourself for a day's work and wind down work well before bedtime
        
5. **Approach each sub-problem separately**    
When the sub-problem has a viable solution, move on to the next sub-problem. Don't try to tackle everything at once. Here, that might look like this list, where each step is taken separately and you give each thing a few days to see how it affects your sleep quality. In programming, of course, this list would perhaps be a bit more sequential, but real life is messy and the results take a while to populate.

  - [1] Make the doctor's appointment.

**Minimal Working (or Reproducible) Examples**

If all else has failed, and you can't figure out what is causing your error, it's probably time to ask for help. If you have a friend or buddy that knows the language you're working in, by all means ask for help sooner - use them as a rubber duck if you have to. But when you ask for help online, often you're asking people who are much more knowledgeable about the topic - members of R core browse stackoverflow and may drop in and help you out. Under those circumstances, it's better to make the task of helping you as easy as possible because it shows respect for their time. The same thing goes for your supervisors and professors.

So, with that said, there are numerous resources for writing what's called a "minimal working example", "reproducible example" (commonly abbreviated reprex), or MCVE (minimal complete verifiable example). Much of this is lifted directly from the StackOverflow post describing a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).

The goal is to reproduce the error message with information that is 

- **minimal** - as little code as possible to still reproduce the problem
- **complete** - everything necessary to reproduce the issue is contained in the description/question
- **reproducible** - test the code you provide to reproduce the problem. 

You should format your question to make it as easy as possible to help you. Make it so that code can be copied from your post directly and pasted into an R script or notebook (e.g. Quarto document code chunk). Describe what you see and what you'd hope to see if the code were working.

## Styling Functions

Part of writing reproducible and shareable code is following good style guidelines. Mostly, this means choosing good object names and using white space in a consistent and clear way.

You should have already seen the sections of the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) relevant to piping, plotting, and naming objects. This week we are extending these style guides to functions.


::: go-read
I would highly recommend reading through the style guide for naming functions, what to do with long lines, and the use of comments. 

Read the tidyverse [style guide for functions](https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html).
:::

In summary, designing functions is somewhat subjective, but there are a few principles that apply:

1. Choose a good, descriptive **names**
  + Your function name should describe what it does, and usually involves a verb.
  + Your argument names should be simple and / or descriptive.
  + Names of variables in the body of the function should be descriptive.
2. Output should be **very predictable**
  + Your function should always return the same object type, no matter what input it gets.
  + Your function should expect certain objects or object types as input, and give errors when it does not get them.
  + Your function should give errors or warnings for common mistakes.
  + Default values of arguments should only be used when there is a clear common choice.
3. The body of the function should be **easy to read**.
  + Code should use good style principles.
  + There should be occasional comments to explain the purpose of the steps.
  + Complicated steps, or steps that are repeated many times, should be written into separate functions (sometimes called helper functions).
4. Functions should be **self-contained**.
  + They should not rely on any information besides what is given as input.
  + *(Relying on other functions is fine, though)*
  + They should not alter the Global Environment
  + Functions should never load or install packages!

## Check-in 7.1: Writing Functions {#checkin7-1 -}

**Simple Functions**

1. Fill in the necessary code to write a function called `times_seven()`. The function should take a single argument (`x`) and multiply the input by 7.
  + This function should check that the argument is numeric.
  + This function should also excitedly announce (print) *“I love sevens!”* if the argument to the function is a 7.

```{r}
#| eval: false
times_seven <- function(x){
  stopifnot(___)

  if(___){
    print(___)
  }
  return(___)
}
```

**Predicting Function Behavior**

2. For the following function, `add_or_subtract()`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
add_or_subtract <- function(first_num,
                            second_num = 2,
                            type = "add") {

  if (type == "add") {
    first_num + second_num
  } else if (type == "subtract") {
    first_num - second_num
  } else {
    stop("Please choose `add` or `subtract` as the type.")
  }

}
```

What will be the output for the following three calls to the `add_or_subtract()` function?

```{r}
#| eval: false
add_or_subtract(5, 6, type = "subtract")

add_or_subtract("orange")

add_or_subtract(5, 6, type = "multiply")
```

  a. 1
  b. -1
  c. 30
  d. An error defined by the function `add_or_subtract()`
  e. An error defined in a different function, which is called inside the `add_or_subtract()` function

3. Consider the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
first_num  <- 5
second_num <- 3

result <- 8

result <- add_or_subtract(first_num, second_num = 4)

result_2 <- add_or_subtract(first_num)
```

In your Global Environment, what is the value of...

a. first_num
b. second_num
c. result
d. result_2

### PA 7: Functions {-}

You will write several small functions, then use them to unscramble a message. Many of the functions have been started for you below, but **none** of them are complete as-is.

Visit [PA 7: Functions](https://earobinson95.github.io/stat331-calpoly/practice-activities/PA7-functions.html) for instructions.

If you have done everything correctly, your final vector will be six numbers long. Google these six numbers to find a TV show as your final answer and submit to Canvas.
